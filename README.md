# COBOL-CODE-Banking-Accounts
Sample COBOL Code for Banking Accounts


This program uses a loop to iterate through an array of account numbers and corresponding balances. For each account, it checks if the balance is negative and displays a message if it is. Then, it adds the balance to a total balance variable. Finally, it sets the bank's overall balance to the total balance and displays the result. This is a simple example, but it could be extended to include more advanced banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.

You can open as .txt and modify as you needed.

Happy Coding :D !!!
